===========

In browser: http://localhost:8000/app/index.html

TODO
----

- The primary contact is a relationship between the tab and the contacts, not a tab/category. Select the tab then select a contact to use with it.

- Having an address without displaying it allows the entry to be searched by location without cluttering the display.

- Sortable/rearrange in the association area.

- Styling selection with the association to include brand colour checkbox.

- Implement the unlink action for associations.

- "Find US" associates contacts with each tab. It then allows locations to be attached to the association.

- Double click from the view takes you to editing the tab/category/contact/association editor.
